<h2>My own primitive neural network</h2>

<p>This is a repo in which i create a very primitive neural network for learning purpose. </p>

<p>After training with a train set of 100 inputs, the network is able to guess the right numbe in certain case. </p>

<p>It gets the number wrong in some other cases. </p>
